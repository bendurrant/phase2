Anytime the user needs to choose from a list they enter the number of the row they wish to select.
Users can log in with an existing username and password or create a new one. 
2 example existing are (login: Ben Durrant, Password: YankeeDoodle) and (login JohnDoe, Password: hunter2) also JohnDoe is an admin
Our admins are able to do everything a regular user can but also has access to secret options that a normal user can not do.
Users are able to create and edit their own THs. When creating a th the user does not add availabilities or keywords.
Instead this information is added when the user chooses to edit their th. Other basic info is what is added when creating a TH. (e.g name, phone,address, etc)
Degrees of separation takes in two user ID's and prints either yes or no depending on if they are two degrees apart. Any user can do this, not just admins.
Whenever we calculate an average score we do not display that average score but order by the score. So the user does not see the average score but sees them in order.
To add a reservation the user must first browse and then select the TH they wish to reserve.
